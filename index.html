    <p> I am Edwin Mbong Mbong from Akwa Ibom State Nigeria. I am the oldest of 5 siblings. 
        I was born and raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I 
        served my mission in Cape Coast, Ghana between 2010 and 2012. I am currently serving as
        a member of the Bishopric in my ward. 
        I Have a high interest in web development and software Engineering which is why I am taking
        this course with BYUI. I am hopeful of becoming a successful software Engineer soon.
