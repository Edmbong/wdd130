            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Clark’s verse collections Poems (1962) and A Reed in the Tide (1965) do not display the degree of 
        craftsmanship apparent in the work of his fellow Nigerian Christopher Okigbo, but in his best poems his
        sensual imagination makes successful use of the patterns of traditional African life. His Casualties: 
        Poems 1966–68 (1970) is concerned primarily with the Nigerian civil war. Other poetry collections included 
        A Decade of Tongues (1981), State of the Union (1985, as J.P. Clark Bekederemo), and Mandela and Other 
        Poems (1988).
        
        Of his plays, the first three (published together under the title Three Plays in 1964) are tragedies in 
        which individuals are unable to escape the doom brought about by an inexorable law of nature or society. 
        Song of a Goat (performed 1961), a family tragedy, was well received throughout Africa and Europe for its 
        dramatic skill and the poetic quality of its language. The Masquerade (performed 1965) again portrays a 
        family tragedy, but it is The Raft (performed 1978) that is considered to be his finest piece of dramatic 
        writing. The situation of four men helplessly adrift on a raft in the Niger River suggests both the human 
        predicament and the dilemma of Nigeria in the modern world. Clark’s characterization is convincing and his
        symbolic setting richly allusive.</p>
